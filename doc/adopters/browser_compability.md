# Browser compatibility issues

- Mobile devices and iOS do not support automatic playback on page load.
- Volume and mute state cannot be controlled on mobile platforms and iOS.
- Native fullscreen is supported in Chrome 15+, Safari 5.1+, Firefox 14+, Microsoft Edge and Safari for iOS 12 (only on iPad). Old browsers will use the full browser window.
- On ios devices support for multiple videos in HLS has been disabled because it consumes a lot of ram memory. This can cause the browser tab to close on low memory devices.
