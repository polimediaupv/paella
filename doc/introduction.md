## How it works ?

Paella Player is a client side multistream player programmed in <span style="color: orange">JavaScript</span> that serves plugins to the user to show and interact with the sources.

## Can i use it ?

Paella Player has been mainly developed by the Universitat Politécnica de Valencia, with portions contributed/copyrighted by others (see the developer credits in the source code itself) and all of it is provided under the terms of the version 3 of the <span style="color: orange">GNU General Public License</span> published by the Free Software Foundation. Anyway, we can provide license exemptions on request. Feel free to contact us.

Paella Player and its documentation are distributed in the hope that they will be useful, but without any warranty; without even the implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. See the GNU General Public License for more details.

## What i need ?

Most <span style="color: orange">HTML5 browsers</span> should work with Paella. By default Paella tries to load the videos using the html5 video tag. If it fails it will use the .swf component to play that video, so Paella should work in any modern browser (through Flash).

We test Paella in <span style="color: orange">Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer and Firefox</span>.
